| Name                    | Meaning / Edge                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SkillSync**           | Clean, tech-friendly—implies perfect synchronization of skills and needs.               |
| **NeuroServe**          | Evokes AI (“Neuro”) + community service (“Serve”)—smart and ethical.                    |
| **KarmaNet**            | Catchy Indian-context pun: a network of good deeds—perfect for NSS.                     |
| **PraNetra (प्रनेत्र)** | Sanskrit for *guiding vision*—represents AI guiding volunteers to where help is needed. |
| **SevaLink**            | From “Seva” (service) + “Link”—sounds natural, directly tied to NSS values.             |
| **Aidra**               | Short for *AI-driven Rural Assistance*; futuristic and minimalist.                      |
| **GramAI**              | Direct, localized, instantly tells the purpose (AI for villages).                       |
| **ServeSense**          | Suggests “sense of service” and also “AI sensing where service is needed.”              |
| **SkillSutra**          | Playful yet elegant—Sanskrit-inspired, connecting skills with needs.                    |
| **TeamDharma**          | “Righteous duty through teamwork”—carries cultural + moral gravity.                     |

---

### 🌱 **Impact-Driven / Humanitarian Names**

| Name                  | Meaning / Edge                                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SahayAI (सहाय)**    | “Sahay” = help in Hindi; AI for community help—simple, powerful.             |
| **MitraMesh**         | “Mitra” = friend; AI-powered friend network for social good.                 |
| **NSSphere**          | Wordplay on “sphere” (community) and “NSS.” Clean branding for campus usage. |
| **LokAI**             | “Lok” = people; AI for the people—elegant and deeply rooted.                 |
| **JanAI (जन-AI)**     | “Jan” = public; “JanAI” reads like “Jannay”—AI for citizens.                 |
| **SamarthAI (समर्थ)** | Means “capable” or “empowered”—symbolizes enabling volunteers with AI.       |

---

### 🧠 **Recommendation (for blend of cleverness + gravitas)**

> **“SahayAI: An Intelligent Volunteer–Need Matching Platform for Community Empowerment”**

Why this stands out:

* Simple yet culturally resonant.
* Implies AI + compassion (fits NSS perfectly).
* Instantly memorable for both hackathon judges and publication reviewers.
* You can say in your pitch:

  > “SahayAI derives from the Hindi word *‘Sahay’*—meaning help or assistance. It’s an AI-driven system that assists NSS units in intelligently connecting volunteer skills to real community needs.”

Would you like me to shortlist **3 final candidates** (with logo tagline + academic title version) for your submission and presentation slides?
11/4/25, 22:41 - Anurag Basistha: select name
11/4/25, 22:42 - Akshit CSD: I want to keep SkillSutra But
11/4/25, 22:43 - Akshit CSD: Lets keep SkillSync or SahayAI
11/4/25, 22:43 - Agrim Upadhyay Roommate: Problem statement mein solution dalte hai?
11/4/25, 22:43 - Akshit CSD: Not really no
11/4/25, 22:44 - Akshit CSD: Abbe problem statement par itna woh mat kar 
Its the solution that matters
11/4/25, 22:44 - Anurag Basistha: isko ye bta
11/4/25, 22:44 - Anurag Basistha: likhna kya h
11/4/25, 22:47 - Agrim Upadhyay Roommate: One of the core NSS goals is to adopt and
assist villages in their sustainable
development. However, identifying
community needs and matching them
with skilled student volunteers remains a
disorganised, manual process. Currently,
volunteers note issues (like broken
infrastructure, lack of digital literacy, or
need for extracurricular support) on
paper, and there is no systematic way to
connect these needs with college
students who have the relevant skills. This
leads to missed opportunities for
meaningful engagement and inefficient
use of campus talent. Ye daal rha mein( from slides)
11/4/25, 22:55 - Akshit CSD: @⁨Anurag Basistha⁩

11/5/25, 08:46 - Anurag Basistha: Mai nahake ata
11/5/25, 09:57 - Anurag Basistha: helloooo
11/5/25, 11:14 - Anurag Basistha: guys
11/5/25, 11:15 - Anurag Basistha: @⁨Akshit CSD⁩ @⁨Agrim Upadhyay Roommate⁩
11/5/25, 11:15 - Anurag Basistha: i found another GREAT PAPER
11/5/25, 11:15 - Anurag Basistha: need u both to read this and think if we can integrate this
11/5/25, 11:16 - Anurag Basistha: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11510
11/5/25, 11:16 - Anurag Basistha: and this
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15037
11/5/25, 11:16 - Anurag Basistha: we must integrate these
11/5/25, 11:29 - Akshit CSD: We need the dataset to train model tho
11/5/25, 11:29 - Akshit CSD: We can write this in the PPT tho and explain
11/5/25, 11:35 - Anurag Basistha: ask gpt
11/5/25, 11:35 - Anurag Basistha: for dataset
11/5/25, 11:35 - Anurag Basistha: ask mentor
11/5/25, 11:49 - Akshit CSD: Theek
11/5/25, 11:50 - Agrim Upadhyay Roommate: Is vale mein se agar willingness score vali cheez daal paye to daal diyo...past history se willingness score determine kar sakte
11/5/25, 12:19 - Akshit CSD: Cool 
Let me start on the ppt
11/5/25, 12:19 - Akshit CSD: @⁨Agrim Upadhyay Roommate⁩ send me link
11/5/25, 12:20 - Akshit CSD: Of boult
11/5/25, 12:20 - Akshit CSD: @⁨Anurag Basistha⁩ sending u some scripts in 10 min
Dekhlio
11/5/25, 12:22 - Anurag Basistha: ok
11/5/25, 12:25 - Agrim Upadhyay Roommate: https://bolt.new/~/sb1-lbpu7fza , try kario khul rha hai ya nhi
11/5/25, 12:31 - Anurag Basistha: <Media omitted>
11/5/25, 12:31 - Anurag Basistha: wtf
11/5/25, 12:32 - Anurag Basistha: @⁨Akshit CSD⁩ backend bana kya
make it all multimodal and ensure regional languages + voice text + image processing using clip or something
11/5/25, 12:32 - Anurag Basistha: willingness score add krdio
11/5/25, 12:33 - Akshit CSD: What the frack 
Regional languages 
Voice text ??
11/5/25, 12:33 - Akshit CSD: Villager ui bhi banana hai ??
11/5/25, 12:33 - Anurag Basistha: bana hi dete hai
11/5/25, 12:33 - Anurag Basistha: bhot kam time lagega
11/5/25, 12:33 - Anurag Basistha: gpt ko bolde bana dega
11/5/25, 12:33 - Anurag Basistha: ye bta
11/5/25, 12:33 - Anurag Basistha: model kaise train krega
11/5/25, 12:33 - Akshit CSD: Ye sab front end ka hai
11/5/25, 12:33 - Akshit CSD: @⁨Agrim Upadhyay Roommate⁩ add translation
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: why translation
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: let it all remain in regional language
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: + voice  + image feature
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: u can just upload image what is the dikkat
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: clip will give text in that embedding
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: backend se integrate to krna hoga n
11/5/25, 12:34 - Anurag Basistha: a
11/5/25, 12:34 - Akshit CSD: usme dikkat nahi honi chahiye
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: cool
11/5/25, 12:35 - Akshit CSD: Local database kardete hai with students with their skills
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: ,
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: aur kya bolna thha
11/5/25, 12:35 - Akshit CSD: and input aayega tab use dekh lenge Text process karnke
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: dekhna tum dono ye lagana hai ya nahi
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: https://chatgpt.com/share/690af73b-45f4-8013-8f01-8c75c9baf4cb
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: ye iss 90 page ahh paper ka crux hai
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: iska
11/5/25, 12:35 - Anurag Basistha: dekhna
11/5/25, 12:36 - Akshit CSD: problem is training
11/5/25, 12:36 - Akshit CSD: we do not have data
11/5/25, 12:36 - Akshit CSD: I think I need to generate data from GPT itself
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: yes
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: give me prompt
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: ill use
11/5/25, 12:36 - Akshit CSD: Probably just to show
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: big brain gpt
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: to big brain data
11/5/25, 12:36 - Akshit CSD: let me modify the script first to add the willingness score as wel
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: is backend python
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: or cpp
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: or what
11/5/25, 12:36 - Akshit CSD: python
11/5/25, 12:36 - Anurag Basistha: wow
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: noiceee
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: finally
11/5/25, 12:37 - Akshit CSD: backend tu bana de 
Aisa kar 
Ya let me finish with the model scripts first
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: <Media omitted>
11/5/25, 12:37 - Akshit CSD: Fir lets see
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: im trying to get a paper on
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: fairness
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: that will complete the entire thing
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: ye dekh na
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: btao
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: tum dono
11/5/25, 12:37 - Anurag Basistha: apni rae
11/5/25, 12:37 - Akshit CSD: I have no other option 
I am not even sure cpp mein backend kaise Banega -_-
11/5/25, 12:38 - Akshit CSD: feels like we are making shaadi.com for NSS
11/5/25, 12:38 - Akshit CSD: Noice
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: ++
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: i mean
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: we can pitch this as startups
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: most startups are this
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: a particular algorithm
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: adapted for solving
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: a particular specific problem
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: given satisfying said constraints
11/5/25, 12:38 - Anurag Basistha: algo remains same mostly
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: the crux of it lies on
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: adapting to problem statement
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: and making ppl believe in it
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: tinder but for disabled ppl
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: tinder but for rich ppl
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: MakeMyTrip but for rich ppl
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: so on
11/5/25, 12:39 - Anurag Basistha: gotta sell it nicely
11/5/25, 12:53 - Anurag Basistha: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05646

Make sure u implemented this algo only from the paper @⁨Akshit CSD⁩
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: @⁨Akshit CSD⁩ @⁨Agrim Upadhyay Roommate⁩ read this
its v useful we should implement this too for stuff like conflict resolution of needs
11/5/25, 12:56 - Akshit CSD: BKLLLLL phele bhej na ye
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: If a volunteer is in two teams whose tasks overlap in time, drop them from the lower-goodness team and recompute that team’s goodness.
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: just
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: add this
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: statement basically
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: thats the entire paper
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: hamara jo goodness score hai
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: aur willingness score hai
11/5/25, 12:56 - Anurag Basistha: dono ko conflict edge se map krke
11/5/25, 12:57 - Anurag Basistha: kam krde
11/5/25, 12:57 - Anurag Basistha: due to time conflicts etc
11/5/25, 12:57 - Anurag Basistha: there u go dont need to read entire paper i read it for u
11/5/25, 12:57 - Anurag Basistha: itna to ho jaega na
11/5/25, 12:57 - Akshit CSD: But how are we supposed to match times 
Thats just extra parameters
11/5/25, 12:57 - Akshit CSD: Because we aren't deciding concretely on the Timings
11/5/25, 12:57 - Anurag Basistha: hmmm
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: <Media omitted>
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: while assigning
11/5/25, 12:58 - Akshit CSD: I mean 
Because if a person does one task 
Then they might not wanna do the other task as well
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: no i mean when we map
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: the need
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: to the person solving
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: obviously we need to look at
a) how urgent the need is
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: depending on that define a time period within which it needs to be solved
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: b) the person solving how free is he available
11/5/25, 12:58 - Anurag Basistha: call krta hu rul
11/5/25, 13:05 - Akshit CSD: @⁨Anurag Basistha⁩ Aisa kar 
Most important is the PPT 
without a Doubt 


Tu PPT ka saara content bana Ek baar 
Jo kuch tujhe theek lag raha 
I will make teh model and edit the ppt according to that
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: @⁨Akshit CSD⁩ @⁨Agrim Upadhyay Roommate⁩ 
i think we should modify it to account for time constraint as in
the volunteers we should kinda ask somehow what time they free want to contribute
and also consider their expertise how helpful they are on qualifications or something
and the problem we have received we can pass it to a language model to decide its priority high low mid
based on that priority (which should be displayed and changable by the frontend admin manually too)
we should update our willingness and other whatever metrics we are using

coz urgent stuff should prefer ppl available quick even if they are not really an expert
and later stuff slow stuff we should prefer experts when they free
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: okay
kabtak chahite abhi sochra thha lunch jaun
11/5/25, 13:06 - Akshit CSD: College or Home ?
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: home
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: hun
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: abhi toh
11/5/25, 13:06 - Akshit CSD: Jidhar bhi hai 
Like jitna jaldi 
ASAP
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: submission kab h
11/5/25, 13:06 - Anurag Basistha: lunch krke bhejda hun
11/5/25, 13:06 - Akshit CSD: I think 8
11/5/25, 13:07 - Anurag Basistha: 8 is presentation ig -
11/5/25, 13:07 - Anurag Basistha: 6 30 submission tha
11/5/25, 13:07 - Anurag Basistha: nd also lets do what akshit said
if volunteer has recently done some duty we should lower their willingness score priority
and give chance to some other volunteer

otherwise theres a good chance they wont accept be tired
11/5/25, 13:08 - Anurag Basistha: toh just more parameters in the mapping eqn basically but
very nice parameters to have
11/5/25, 13:08 - Anurag Basistha: we should display some metric of this per volunteer in frontend
expertise level and
recently jobbed when willingness level
11/5/25, 13:08 - Anurag Basistha: and urgency of job level of
11/5/25, 13:08 - Anurag Basistha: c
11/5/25, 13:12 - Akshit CSD: I am building a machine learning model that predicts which people are suitable for a given real-world project proposal.
I need a synthetic but realistic dataset in CSV format with three files:

✅ 1) proposals.csv

Columns:

proposal_id

text (description of a small real-world engineering or social project)

Create 50 unique proposals, spanning multiple domains:

environmental engineering (river cleaning, waste management)

water quality testing

IoT sensor deployments

GIS mapping

renewable energy micro-projects

community outreach & awareness

policy & regulation studies

app development or UX for civic tech

Make each proposal 2–4 sentences and specific (mention tasks, constraints, goals).

✅ 2) people.csv

Columns:

person_id

name

text (2–3 sentences describing their skills, coursework, project experience)

willingness_eff (0.0–1.0)

willingness_bias (0.0–1.0)

Generate 40–60 people.
Each person should have 4–8 skills but written naturally inside text, not as a list.
Include diverse skill sets: hydrology, water testing, mechanical pumps, GIS, remote sensing, app development, data analysis, microbiology, safety management, policy, procurement, community outreach, documentation, machine learning, etc.

Make willingness realistic:

high: students passionate about the topic

low: busy students or skills not aligned

✅ 3) pairs.csv

Columns:

proposal_id

person_id

label (1 if the person is a good candidate for that proposal, 0 otherwise)

For every proposal, label:

3–6 positives (label = 1)

6–10 negatives (label = 0), but they must be “hard negatives”: smart people, some overlap in skills, but still not a good match for the specific project.

Very important:

Ensure every proposal_id and person_id in pairs.csv exists in proposals.csv and people.csv.

Make the labels realistic (it should not be random).

Distribute willingness realistically: highly willing candidates should be more likely to be positive labels.

✅ Output format (very important)

Produce 3 CSVs, each in a clean code block:

First block: proposals.csv
Second block: people.csv
Third block: pairs.csv

Do not compress them or combine them.
Make sure the CSVs have a header row and no trailing commas.
